# MS Access Table Size Analysis 

## How it works
Collect all non-system tables in database.

Export every table to temporary database and compare size of file before and after.

Show table with collected information about tables and delete temporary DB file.

## Preparation
Copy this Sub to module and run it with F5.

Don\'t forget to delete temporary table (*Const StTable*) manually.

## Prerequisites
Tested with MS Access 2010 and .mdb file.

If you have table with multivalued field you will get error 3838.
